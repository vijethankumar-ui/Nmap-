# NEXT STEPS (what to do after researching services)

1. Prioritize risks (see `docs/RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`).
2. Prepare remediation actions and share with system owner.
3. If permitted and needed, run further tests (credentialed scans, vulnerability scanners like OpenVAS or Nessus).
4. Re-scan after remediation and document changes.
