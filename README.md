# Nmap-
A small-scale local network research using Nmap application. 

# Network Scan 

This repository contains a small layout for performing local network connections with Nmap on Windows (Git Bash / PowerShell). It includes scripts, example scan output, and guidance for researching services and documenting risks.

**Repository layout**
- `docs/` — step-by-step guides and research resources
- `scripts/` — small helper scripts (bash) that work in Git Bash on Windows
- `samples/` — example Nmap output and screenshots (replace with your real scans)
- 
## Quick start
1. Open the repository.
2. Read `docs/STEP_BY_STEP.md` to follow the stepwise workflow.
3. Put your Nmap output into `samples/` and run `scripts/parse_nmap.sh` to build a ports summary.
